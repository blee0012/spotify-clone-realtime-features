#### Why use both JavaScript and TypeScript?
Using both JavaScript and TypeScript in this one project showcases my broad range of skills. I am able to demonstrate my ability to adapt to different project needs and environments. For example, when working with a team, I'll be able to understand how to collaborate with different team members that may prefer one language over the other. I am able to apply my skills and experience into this real-world scenario of creating an application that requires me to be consistent and comfortable in the programming languages that I am using.

- Team environments
- Ability to adapt
- Consistency
- Critical thinking

In my free time, I enjoy watching films and shows. I am a big cinematography nerd so I enjoy studying how camera angles, light, sound, colors, and writing are able to create an entire scene and how those elements get the audience to feel the intended emotion for that specific scene. I enjoy the art of cinemtatography and I continue to. I am passionate about these details which is why I am able to express my love for intricacy in programming.
